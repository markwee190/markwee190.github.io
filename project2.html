									<h2>Public Sentiment Analysis on Lab-Grown Meat</h2>
									<p>In December 2020, Singapore became the first country in the world to legalise lab-grown meat for commercial use. Since this is quite a novelty, not much research has been done to analyse the public sentiments surrounding this affair.</p>
								</header>
								<p>The raw data used for the analysis was derived from the Reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k6ol09/nokill_labgrown_meat_to_go_on_sale_for_first_time/"> "<i>No-kill, lab-grown meat to go on sale for first time. Singapore’s approval of chicken cells grown in bioreactors is seen as landmark moment across industry</i>"</a>. The Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) library was used to scrape the comments. After cleaning the data by removing stopwords and nonsensical comments, 448 comments were gathered before generating a word cloud as seen in Figure 1. We can see from the word cloud that there are concerns pertinent to “taste”, “waste”, “better”, “price” and “suffering”.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>The data was then analysed by applying VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis, which is a tool specifically attuned to sentiments on social media comments. In short, the VADER tool determines how positive or negative a particular comment is. The percentage of comments by sentiment type (Positive/Neutral/Negative) is seen in Table 1, and the distribution of the VADER scores are represented in Figure 2. We can see that the scores are more positive than negative.</p>

                            <p>Topic modelling was also conducted to try and group different comments and classify them under a single topic as can be seen from Figure 3. Some broadly-defined topics can be 
                                centred around the <i>ethicality</i> (zombie, animal, farm), <i>taste</i> (eat, taste, vegan, food, tofu), <i>future</i> of lab-grown meat (future, cost, year, time) and the <i>industrialisation</i> (risk, industry, tyson, company).
