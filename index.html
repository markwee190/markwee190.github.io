									<h2>Why Data Analytics?</h2>
									<p>Data is all around us. In this day and age, data is truly ubiquitous and many of us 
										dont actually know how much it affects our daily lives. We generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of 
										data a day, with this pace only increasing with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT). The sheer size of 
										this data means that the potential for new insights, discoveries and breakthroughs lie at the tip of our 
										fingers. As an undergraduate pursuing a multi-disciplinary major (Business, IT, Social Science), I see immense
										value in harnessing the tremendous value of this data at our disposal, to transform and build upon these insights 
										in the fields of Business and Information Technology.
										
										Do feel free to check out some of my projects that i have worked on throughout the years.

										<h2>Enviromental, Social and Governance (ESG) ETF Optimization</h2>
										
									</header>
									<img src="images/efficient_frontier.png" alt="" style = "width:400px;height:300px;" > 
									<p>There are business opportunities that arise, particularly for asset
										managers in our case, from evolving investors’ perceptions towards organizations that carefully adopt
										Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) directives. We were tasked to create a interactive dashboard based on financial analytics principles. We explored deeper into the model-building
										and fine-tuning phase, highlighting the underlying principles which make up the core of our model for optimisation and
										on the rationale and methods of computing output from our input. Once the groundwork is laid, the model is built and 
										snapshots are included to demonstrate how the model functions and what our client is
										able to achieve with the model created. </p>

										<h2>Topping the Charts: A study on the factors affecting the popularity of Google Play mobile applications using clustering and classification techniques<br />
										</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/SHAP Summary Plot for KNN.png" alt="" style = "width:393px;height:278px;" > 
									<p>The popularity of 816 mobile applications on Google Play Store are analysed in this study in terms of quantitative statistics and objective figures, as well as qualitative factors drawn from user reviews. A range of 13 classification models were applied to the quantitative figures, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation and K-means clustering methods were applied on user reviews to determine factors that contribute to mobile application popularity. </p>

										<h2>Reimagining Public Spaces: The future of Singapore's Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS)</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" alt="" style = "width:400px;height:300px;" > 
									<p>It is often believed that pedestrains in Singapore are used to the high-density urban environment.
										However, there is a lack of understanding on the threshold of tolerance levels among different groups of people. We conducted a study on how various
										environmental and human factors influence a person's perception on threshold density levels of crowdedness and vibrancy in a POPS or public space
										near a waterfront. Through these findings, we aim to generate recommendations for improving user comfort/experience, such that generalisable insights can be
										applied to similar areas.

									<p>Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has developed greatly in recent years, with software like ESRI's ArcGIS improving the analysis and visualisation of data using maps. Although there have been many studies to measure aspatial accessibility to healthcare in America, not much has been done in terms of geographical considerations.</p>

									<p>In December 2020, Singapore became the first country in the world to legalise lab-grown meat for commercial use. Since this is quite a novelty, not much research has been done to analyse the public sentiments surrounding this affair.</p>

										<h2>Measuring the Impact of COVID-19 on<br />
										Mental Health in Singapore using the BERT Model</a></h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/project3.png" alt="" />
									<p>Singapore is usually ranked amongst the top in the international indexes — from the world’s highest GDP per capita to life expectancy. Singaporeans have all the reasons to be happy. However, Singaporean are the unhappiest in the world with one of the highest rates of depression in Asia. 
										The already poor mental health state of Singapore is exacerbated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic resulting in a surge in mental health issues since the 2020 Circuit Breaker. This project aimed to assess the emotional well-being of Singaporeans and examine how it has been affected by Covid-19.</p>								<ul class="actions special">
