									  <p>Hello there! My name is Mark Wee and I am currently a penultimate student studying in Singapore Management University School 
										  of Computing and Information Systems, majoring in Smart City Management and Technology, with a second major in Business Analytics.
										  <br><br>
										  As an outgoing individual, I chose to strike a strong work-life balance in SMU. I am eager in my pursuit of knowledge, especially within the field of my degree, Information Systems. I also currently serve as the Music Director of SMU's resident Afro-Brazilian percussion band. Learning to maintain a healthy GPA while juggling such external commitments has allowed me to grow into a driven and detail-focused individual.
										  <br><br>
										  As someone who has always found quantitative subjects such as Math and Science to be my forte, pursuing a degree in Information Systems has been second nature to me as my strong points complement the skills required to excel in this field. I have chosen to pursue the Smart-City Management and Technology Major because i see the value in not only constraining myself in the Business IT sector, but harnessing such technologies to deliver innovative solutions and services to improve the lives of citizens in society.<br><br></p>
